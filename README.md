# CMPG-323-Overview---34587187

For the project, I created the CMPG 323 - Overview repository. This will be the main repository that will be used for the majority of the projects, but additional repositories may be created as needed.

## Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that I will use for the projects is Trunk-based Development(TBD), as this branching strategy is best suited for individuals and small teams and features continuous integration and updating which is in-line with the goals of the projects. This also simplifies the view of my projects as there is no need for any branches.

## .gitignore File Implementation
The .gitignore file will be used to hide certain files that GitHub should not track when committing my projects to my GitHub repository, like credentials and .vs files as I plan on coding with C# in Visual Studio.

## Securing Credentials and Sensitive Information
To secure credentials and sensitive information, I will ensure that these types of information will not be added or committed to any of my projects. Any credentials or sensitive information will be stored in a folder separate from the repository folder.

## Project 2 - API
The CRUD RESTful API should be used to connect to a database storing IoT device data. The API contains get, post, patch and delete methods to manage, monitor and maintain the IoT device database.
