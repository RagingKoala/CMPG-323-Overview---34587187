# CMPG-323-Overview---34587187

For the project, I created the CMPG 323 - Overview repository. This will be the main repository that will be used for the majority of the projects, but additional repositories may be created as needed.

The branching strategy that I will use for the projects is Trunk-based Development(TBD), as this branching strategy is best suited for individuals and small teams and features continuous integration and updating which is in-line with the goals of the projects. This also simplifies the view of my projects as there is no need for any branches.

The .gitignore file will be used to hide certain files that GitHub should not track when committing my projects to my GitHub repository

To secure credentials and sensitive information, I will ensure that these types of information will not be added or committed to any of my projects.
